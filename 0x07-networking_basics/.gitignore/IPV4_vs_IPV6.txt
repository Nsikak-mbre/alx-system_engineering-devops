What is Internet Protocol (IP)?
IP (short for Internet Protocol) specifies the technical format of packets
 and the addressing scheme for computers to communicate over a network.
Most networks combine IP with a higher-level protocol called Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP), which establishes a virtual connection between a
 destination and a source.

IP by itself can be compared to something like the postal system.
 It allows you to address a package and drop it in the system, 
 but thereâ€™s no direct link between you and the recipient. TCP/IP, 
 on the other hand, establishes a connection between two hosts so that 
 they can send messages back and forth for a period of time
