In computer networking, localhost is a hostname that refers to the 
current computer used to access it. The name localhost is reserved for 
loopback purposes.[1] It is used to access the network services that are 
running on the host via the loopback network interface. 
Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.



The local loopback mechanism may be used to run a network service on a 
host without requiring a physical network interface, or without making the 
service accessible from the networks the computer may be connected to. 
For example, a locally installed website may be accessed from a Web 
browser by the URL http://localhost to display its home page
