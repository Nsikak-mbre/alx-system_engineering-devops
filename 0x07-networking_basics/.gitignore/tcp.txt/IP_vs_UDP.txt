TCP/IP is a suite of protocols used by devices to communicate over the
Internet and most local networks.
It is named after two of it's original protocols---the Transmission Control 
Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP provides apps a way to 
deliver (and receive) an ordered and error-checked stream of information 
packets over the network.


The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used by apps to deliver a faster 
stream of information by doing away with error-checking. When configuring 
some network hardware or software, you may need to know the difference.


Both sends packet via the IP, and main difference lies in the error checked
ability of TCP over UDP, UDP is mostly used for streaming and online games,
as it doesnt bother with error checking
