IP Address
==========

Consist of 4 number seperated by periods, ranges from 0-255

An example of how an IP address appears is: 192.168.1.10,
there are a total 4,294,967,296 possible IP addresses.

3 special ranges

a)  The first is the 0.0.0.0 address and refers to the default network

b) the 255.255.255.255 address which is called the broadcast address. 

        These addresses are used for routing, the two mentioned above are
said to be reserved, and are not considered usable

IP CONFLICT, happens when two devcices are assigned the same IP, rare
but implies, both computers can't communicate with each other

                    DEFAULT 
                    =======
Default Network: The special network 0.0.0.0 is generally used 
for routing.


                CLASS A 
                ========
Class A: From the table above you see that there are 126 class A networks.
 These networks consist of 16,777,214 possible IP addresses that can be 
 assigned to devices and computers. This type of allocation is generally 
 given to very large networks such as multi-national companies.


                CLASS B 
                =======
Class B: This class consists of 16,384 individual networks, 
each allocation consisting of 65,534 possible IP addresses. 
These blocks are generally allocated to Internet Service Providers and 
large networks, like a college or major hospital.


                    CLASS C 
                    =======

Class C: There is a total of 2,097,152 Class C networks available, 
with each network consisting of 255 individual IP addresses. 
This type of class is generally given to small to mid-sized companies. 


Class D: The IP addresses in this class are reserved for a service 
called Multicast.


Class E: The IP addresses in this class are reserved for experimental use.

Broadcast: This is the special network of 255.255.255.255, 
and is used for broadcasting messages to the entire network that your 
computer resides on.


                        PRIVATE ADDRESS 
                        ================

There are also blocks of IP addresses that are set aside for internal
 private use for computers not directly connected to the Internet.

These IP addresses are used for internal use by company or home networks
that need to use TCP/IP but do not want to be directly visible on the
Internet.                    


Class           Private Start Address         Private End Address
A               10.0.0.0                        10.255.255.255
B               172.16.0.0                      172.31.255.255
C               192.168.0.0                     192.168.255.255
