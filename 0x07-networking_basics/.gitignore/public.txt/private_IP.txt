What is a public IP address?
A public IP address is the address that is assigned to a computing device 
to allow direct access over the Internet. A web server, email server, and 
any server device directly accessible from the Internet are candidates for
 a public IP address. A public IP address is globally unique, and can only
  be assigned to a unique device.


  What is a private IP address?
A private IP address is the address space allocated by InterNIC to allow
 organizations to create their own private network. There are three IP
  blocks (1 class A, 1 class B, and 1 class C) reserved for private use.
   The computers, tablets, and smartphones sitting behind your home, and 
   the personal computers within an organization are usually assigned 
   private IP addresses. A network printer residing in your home is 
   assigned a private address so that only your family can print to your
    local printer.
