The Open systems Interconnection model is a reference model that provides 
a common basis for the co-ordination of standards development for the 
purpose of system Interconnection.

In OSI, communication are split into 7 abstraction layers
1) Physical
2) Data-link
3) Network
4) Transport
5) Session
6) Presentation
7) Application



Layer 1: Physical layer
    The Physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception
    of unstructured raw data between a device and a Physical transmission
    medium

Layer 2: Data link layer

The data link layer provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two 
directly connected nodes, It defined the protocol to establish and 
terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. it also
defines the protocol for flow control between them


Layer 3: Network layer

The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of -
transferring packets from one node to another connected in different
networks

Layer 4: Transport layer

    The transport layer provides the functional and procedural mans of
    transferring variable length data sequences from a host to a destina-
    tion hsot from one application to another across a network, while
    maintaining the quality of service functions

Layer 5: Session layer

    The session layer creates the set-up, control the connections, and ends
    the teardown, between two or more computers, which is called a 'session'


Layer 6: Presentation lay
